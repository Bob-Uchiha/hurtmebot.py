I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back whats on my mind
And if they ask me how I'm doing I say I'm just fine
AND IF THEY ASK ME HOW I'M DOING I SAY I'M JUST FINE
...
But the fact is
...
I can never get off of my mattress
...
And all that they can ask is
...
Why are you so sad kid?
(Why are you so sad kid)
...
That's what the MASK IS
That's what the point of the mask is
...
So you can see me tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good
(Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I'll keep on smilin' I'm good
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's real, so long, it's real
...
Always bein'judged by a bunch of strange faces
Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages
But I been places
So I'm okay-ish
So I'm okay-ish
YEAH I'M OKAY BITCH
But the fact is
...
I need help I'm failing all my classes
...
They think that I need GLASSES
...
I just really wish that I could pass this
(Wish that I could pass this)
...
That's what the MASK is
...
That's what the point of the mask is
...
So you can see me tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good
(Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I'll keep on smilin' I'm good
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's real, so long, it's real
